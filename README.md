# TicTacToeOnline
A simple Tic Tac Toe online game

The idea is to have a game for two people to play over the internet. As of now I want to add ability to request a new game, leave, change nickname, send messages to your
opponent


Beacuse it's my first attempt to write a program using UWP you can provide any ideas, solutions for bugs and/or errors you might find.

For playing over internet you need either forward a port or install a software like Hamachi
